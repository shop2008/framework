 *  The Xid interface is a Java mapping of the X/Open transaction identifier
 *  XID structure.
 *  <p>
 *  A transaction id is an aggregate of three parts:
 *  <ul>
 *  <li> The format identifier indicates the transaction family and tells
 *       how the other two parts should be interpreted.
 *  </li>
 *  <li> The global transaction id denotes, with the format specifier, the
 *       id of the global transaction.
 *  </li>
 *  <li> The branch qualifier denotes a particular branch of the global
 *       transaction.
 *  </li>
 *  </ul>
 *  <p>
 *  The Xid interface is used by the application server, the transaction manager
 *  and the resource managers, and is not used in application programs.
